Project Overview
This repository contains a detailed analysis of gene expression data and annotations from various scientific projects. The focus is on understanding gene expression across different cancer types, exploring human genome annotations, and performing differential gene expression analysis.

Projects Included
1. TCGA Gene Expression Analysis
This project involves analyzing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) across 30 different cancer types. The analysis includes:

Integration of Annotations: Incorporation of various genomic annotations to enhance the depth of analysis.
Differential Gene Expression (DGE) Analysis: Identification of genes with significant expression changes between cancer types.
Visualizations: Utilization of R to create informative visualizations that reveal potential biomarkers for targeted therapies.
2. Human Genome Annotation
The GENCODE project provides a comprehensive and high-quality annotation of the human and mouse genomes. Key aspects include:

Gene Features: Classification and identification of all gene features, including protein-coding genes, non-coding RNAs, and pseudogenes.
Gene Structures and Transcripts: Detailed information on gene structures, transcripts, and functional elements.
Research Support: Essential data for research in genomics, biology, and medicine.
3. Differential Gene Expression (DGE) Analysis
Differential gene expression analysis focuses on identifying genes that show significant changes in expression levels between different conditions, such as:

Cell Types: Variations between different cell types.
Disease States: Differences between diseased and healthy states.
Experimental Treatments: Effects of experimental treatments on gene expression.
This analysis is crucial for understanding the biological factors driving phenotypic differences and can be used to identify potential biomarkers or therapeutic targets.
